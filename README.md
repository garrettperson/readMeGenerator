# Professional README Generator 

  ## Description
  My motivation in building this project was to learn more about node.js. I built this project to create a professional README.md file to accompany a given project. The application solves the problem of creating a README file from scratch. I learned more about node.js while I built this project.

  ## Installation
  
  First one needs to have node.js installed. Next one needs to install inquirer using npm i inquirer@8.2.4. The application should run successfully after these have been installed.

  ## Usage

  To use the project one simply navigates to the index.js file and opens an integrated terminal. Then one runs the command node index.js. After that one simply answers each of the prompts to generate a unique README.md file. 

  ## Credits

  To create this project I watched a YouTube tutorial on creating a README generator (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VUQABoFOqw), I browsed StackOverflow, consulted with ChatGPT, and received help from a friend who is an experienced coder.
